        1.  Be correct as determined by @dailyiqchallenge
        <br><br>
        2.  Contain an adequate explation of the rationale behind the answer.  Any rationale that is of equal or lesser complexity to the rationale used to formulate the question may be considered correct, as determined by @dailyiqchallenge.  In other words, any rationale that is correct and reasonably simple will likely be considered correct.
        <br><br> 
        3.  Be posted prior to any other correct answer.  There will never be more than one winner per contest.
        <br><br> 
        4.  Be posted within 24 hours of the contest post.  The contest expires after 24 hours.
